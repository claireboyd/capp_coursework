## CAPP 121: Computer Science with Applications 1

Programming Assignments:
* [Modeling Epidemics](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa1/index.html) (Introduction to Programming)
  * Summary: This first assignment provided an introduction to basic programming concepts and skills. In this assignment, I wrote code to simulate a simplified version of the SIR epidemic model. My code modeled how infection spreads through a city from residents to their neighbors.
  * Topics covered: control flow statements (for loops, while loops), data types (lists, tuples, strings, integers, floats, booleans)
* [Modeling Language Shifts](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa2/index.html)) (Functions)
  * Summary: This assignment provided an introduction to defining and using functions. In this assignment, I implemented a variation of the language shift model described by Beltran, et al. in their paper [A Language Shift Simulation Based on Cellular Automata](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259557981_A_Language_Shift_Simulation_Based_on_Cellular_Automata).
