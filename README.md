## CAPP 121: Computer Science with Applications 1

Programming Assignments:
* [Modeling Epidemics](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa1/index.html) (Introduction to Programming)
  * *Summary:* This first assignment provided an introduction to basic programming concepts and skills. In this assignment, I wrote code to simulate a simplified version of the SIR epidemic model. My code modeled how infection spreads through a city from residents to their neighbors.
  * *Topics covered:* control flow statements (for loops, while loops), data types (lists, tuples, strings, integers, floats, booleans)
* [Modeling Language Shifts](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa2/index.html) (Functions)
  * *Summary*: This assignment provided an introduction to defining and using functions. In this assignment, I implemented a variation of the language shift model described by Beltran, et al. in their paper [A Language Shift Simulation Based on Cellular Automata](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259557981_A_Language_Shift_Simulation_Based_on_Cellular_Automata) to model how use of language shifts depending on neighborhood characteristics.
  * *Topics covered:* anatomry of a function, default parameters, return statements, manual and automatic testing
* [Analyzing Candidate Tweets](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa3/index.html) (Dictionaires and File Basics)
  * *Summary:* This assignment provided an introduction to python dictionaries and working with multiple files. For this assignment, I analyzing tweets sent from the official Twitter accounts of four British political parties: the Conservative and Unionist Party (@Conservatives), the Labour Party (@UKLabour), the Liberal Democrats (@LibDems) and the Scottish National Party (@theSNP) during purdah. I looked at favorite hashtags, most frequent mentions, and most frequent phrases used by different political parties.
  * *Topics covered:* dictionaries, sets, nested dictionariess, comprehensions, decomposition, abstraction, k-mers
* [Polling Places](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa4/index.html) (Classes and Objects)
  * *Summary:* The goal of this assignment is to practice designing and implementing classes and methods, and working with class instances. In this assignment, I wrote code to simulate the flow of voters through polling places and analyze the interplay the number of voting booths assigned to a precinct and the amount of time voters spend waiting in line.
  * *Topics covered:* stacks, queues, object-oriented programming, classes, attributes (class vs. instance attributes), methods (e.g. dunder)
* [Linear Regression](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa5/index.html) (NumPy)
  * *Summary:* For this assignment, I fit linear regression models and implement a few simple feature variable selection algorithms. The assignment gave me experience with NumPy and more practice with using classes and functions to support code reuse.
  * *Topics covered:* NumPy, operations on arrays (creating, shaping, slicing, indexing, fancy indexing)
* [Visualizing Avian Biodiversity Using Treemaps](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa6/index.html) (Recursion)
  * *Summary:* This assignment provided an opportunity to create higher-order functions, recursive functions, and recursively-defined data structures. I wrote code to generate treemaps to visualize this avian biodiversity data from samples taken throughout the year.
  * *Topics covered:* trees, recursion, binary search tree, data visualization


## CAPP 122: Computer Science with Applications 2

Programming Assignments:
* [Markovian Candidate]() (Program Structure)
  * *Summary:* 
  * *Topics covered:* 
* [Scraping Chicago Parks]() (Web Scraping)
  * *Summary:* 
  * *Topics covered:*
